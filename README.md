## Binary Classification of Pass/Fail Exam Score
This project aims to create a basic binary classification system using a perceptron model. The 
system will predict whether a student passes or fails based on their scores in three subjects. 
For example, you may choose: Math, Science, and English. The user will enter the scores 
through a graphical user interface (GUI), and the perceptron model will output a pass or fail 
prediction.

## Methodology
1. Data Preparation
Prepare a small dataset of students with their scores in three courses along with their pass/fail status.

The dataset will be used to train the perceptron model.

2. Train the Perceptron
   
• Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

• Initialize and train the perceptron model using the training set. 

Make sure your GUI have the following:

• Allow the user to enter the data dynamically

• Allow the user to enter the learning rate, maximum number of epochs, goal.

• Show the system performance and accuracy.

• Allow the user to test the model by entering an out of sample data.
